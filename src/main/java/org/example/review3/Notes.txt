Scanner Class in Java:
   Scanner is a class just like the classes that we create,
   but it is specially designed so that others can use it.
   This class has a lot of methods which help us take
   the input from the keyboard.

   Logical Operators:
     Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions.
     There are 3 logical operators in Java.
     AND - && : helps us combine the conditions in a way that we
     only get overall true if every condition is true

     OR - || : Logical OR helps us to combine multiple boolean conditions
     in a way that when one condition is true the overall is true.

     NOT - !: Reverses the conditions if something is true it will
     make it false and if something is false it will make it true.


     Loops:
       Loops help us repeat a block of code as long as the condition is true.
     Why should w use Loops:
       Loops helps us reduce duplicate code.
     Types of Loops in Java:
       While - we should use the while loop when we do not know the number
       of iterations in advance.
       Do While
       For - is better when we know the number of the iterations in advance.



When we should use switch statements
We should use switch when we are checking the same variable against
multiple values and foreach value we want to do something different.
