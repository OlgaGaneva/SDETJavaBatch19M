Break keyword:
    Break keyword breaks the loop. We always use Break keyword with is condition
    is met it stops the loop even if there are still iterations remaining.
Why we should use Break:
    If we can save a lot of unnecessary processing by terminating the loop once
    the goal is complete.
Continue:
     Continue keyword is used to skip the unnecessary calculations.
     If an element meets a condition that element is skipped, we move to the next element.
Why we should use?
     To save resources to avid unnecessary calculations.
Note:
     Break and continue keywords are always written with if conditions inside the loop.
2D Arrays:
     2D Array is simple multiple one D arrays combine together in for of rows and
     columns. To pull or store information in 2D array we use two indexis,
     one to specify the row and the second to specify the column.
