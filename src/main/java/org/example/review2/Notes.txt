Type casting:
  Type casting is moving the data from one data to another.
  When we move something from the small data type to large
  data type it's called auto/widening/implicit
  When we move something from the bigger box to the smaller
  it is called Manual/Narrowing/Explicit
  Data types
  1. byte
  2. short
  3. int
  4. long
  5. float
  6. double
When should we use the type casting?
  when we combine the code from the different resources we might
  need to perform this type casting to make the code compatible.
Relational operators:
  Relational operators helps us compare data. They always return
  the results in the form of either a true or a false.
  == if something is same or not, it returns true
  != if something is not same, it returns true
  > if the value on left side is grater than right side, return true
  < if the value on left side is smaller than right side, return true
  >= if the value on left side is grater or equal than right side, return true
  <= if the value on left side is smaller or equal than right side, return true

If Statements:
   If Statements helps the computer to execute the code conditionally.
   Without If Conditions almost all the programs will be useless.
   They will not be able to take any decisions.
   There are many variations of these statements:
   1. If statement
   2. If Else statement
   3. Else If statement
   4. Nested If statement
If Else Statements:
     one condition two actions.
If Else If Statement
     multiple conditions multiple actions.
Nested if:
     When one condition is dependent on another condition
     that's when we use nested statement.
