what are variables?
    Variables are like containers that we use to store the data in our programs.
what are DataTypes?
        DataTypes are used to store/identify different type of data in variables.
Primitive dataTypes:
  there are eight basic dataTypes in Java:
  byte = the extra small  whole number box
  short = the small whole number box
  int = medium
  long = extra long
  float = small container for decimal numbers
  double = medium container for decimal number
  char = smallest datatype for storing the characters
  boolean = store true or false
Non primitive dataTypes:
    Are advance data types build using above mentioned 8 primitive data types
Sprint = most popular


How do we decide what data type we should use for a variable?
   We decide based on two things, one is what type of data we are planing to store
   and second what type of operations we will be performing on the data.

What are naming conventions in Java:
   For a variable we use camelCase.
   For a class name we use PascalCase.
   The name of packages ar always in lowercase.
String concatenations:
   String concatenation allows us to join two strings together.

Arithmetic operators:
Are simply the symbols that we acne use to perform simple math operations + - / * %
